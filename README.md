# WHAT-do you expect here?

`c-ringbuf` is a simple ring buffer implementation in C.

It includes support for `read(2)` and `write(2)` operations on ring buffers, `memcpy`'s into and out of ring buffers, setting the buffer contents to a constant value, and copies between ring buffers. It also supports searching for single characters, for use with line-oriented or character-delimited network protocols.

It should be fairly straightforward to extend `c-ringbuf` to support other C library operations that operate on buffers, e.g., `recv(2)`.

# WHY -i need this?

I implemented `c-ringbuf` because I needed a simple, dependency-free ring buffer type for use with network services written in C.

# INSTALLING

`c-ringbuf` is not a library as such, so it doesn't need to be installed. Just copy the `ringbuf.[ch]` source files into your project. (Also see [LICENSE](#license) below.)

`c-ringbuf` has no dependencies beyond an ISO C90 standard library.

Note that `ringbuf.c` contains several `assert()` statements. These are intended for use with the test harness (see below), and should probably be removed from production code, once you're confident that `c-ringbuf` works as intended.

This distribution includes source for a test program executable (`ringbuf-test.c`), which runs extensive unit tests on the `c-ringbuf` implementation. On most platforms (other than Windows, which is not supported), you should be able to type `make` to run the unit tests. Note that the [Makefile](Makefile) uses the `clang` C compiler by default, but also has support for `gcc` -- just edit the [Makefile](Makefile) so that it uses `gcc` instead of `clang`.

The [Makefile](Makefile) also includes targets for `gcov` coverage testing and `valgrind` memory testing, assuming you have those tools installed on your system.

# LICENSE

`c-ringbuf` has no license; it is dedicated to the public domain. See the file [COPYING](COPYING), included in this distribution, for the specifics.
